<p>
  JOSE papers should:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>List all authors and affiliations.</li>
  <li>Describe the submission, and explain its eligibility for JOSE.</li>
  <li>Include a _Statement of Need_, explaining how the submitted 
    artifacts contribute to computationally enabled teaching and learning, and describing how they 
    might be adopted by others.</li>
  <li>For software submissions, describe the functionality of the software, usage and 
    recent experience of use in teaching and learning situations.</li>
  <li>For learning modules, 
    describe the learning objectives, content, instructional design, and experience of use in 
    teaching and learning situations.</li>
  <li>Tell us the "story" of the project: how did it come to be?</li>
  <li>List key references including a link to the open archive of the sofware or the 
    learning module.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  JOSE welcomes submissions with diverse educational contexts. You should write your paper
  for a non-specialist reader. Your submission should probably be around
  1000 words (or around two pages).
</p>
<p>
  The goal is that someone reading the JOSE paper has enough information to decide if they'd
  be interested in adoping the learnig module or software.
  Readers will want to know how the content/software has been used, and how they would adopt it.
  They may also want to be persuaded that the authors have put careful work on creating the material,
  and have experience teaching with it.
</p>

<p>
JOSE papers contain a limited set of metadata, plus Summary & Reference sections. We explicitly
  do not publish long-form articles, because the scholarship represented by a JOSE article is
  contained in the software or learning modules themselves. Expected length less than 1000 words.
